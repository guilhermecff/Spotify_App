Music Taste Analyzer
Overview
Music Taste Analyzer is an advanced tool designed to dissect and understand a user's musical preferences by analyzing their top 500 songs from Spotify. Utilizing Python and libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas, this project extracts and visualizes a wide array of audio features to uncover underlying patterns and trends in music preferences.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide users and researchers with a deep understanding of music tastes through statistical analysis and data visualization. By analyzing Spotify data, the Music Taste Analyzer identifies preferred genres, artists, and music styles, based on various audio features such as tempo, danceability, energy, and more.

How It Works
Data Collection: The tool uses Spotify’s API to fetch the top 500 songs from a user’s listening history, including tracks and their associated audio features.
Data Processing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to align with the analysis requirements.
Visualization and Analysis: Using various data visualization libraries, the application generates multiple forms of graphical representations that highlight different aspects of the music data.
Insights and Conclusions: Based on the visualizations and audio features analysis, the tool draws conclusions about the user's music taste, providing both detailed data-driven insights and general trends.
